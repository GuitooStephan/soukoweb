# Souko

Souko is a web-based application designed to simplify 
store management. Its services can be summarized in two 
main tasks:
- Centralize the management of inventory, customers, and 
orders in one location.
- Create a personalized e-commerce page to sell your 
products.

## Project description

Opening a first business can be a daunting task for most 
entrepreneurs as they encounter numerous challenges, 
including managing their inventory, customer relations, 
and sales. Existing solutions can be time-consuming and 
difficult to set up and utilize. However, Souko offers a 
user-friendly solution that enables store owners to manage 
their business operations with greater ease.

## Architecture

The solution was constructed using the **MVP 
architecture**, with the API built on **Django**, 
utilizing a **Postgres Database** and **Celery** Workers. 
The web interface was developed using **Angular**.
